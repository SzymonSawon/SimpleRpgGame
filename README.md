# SimpleRpgGame
I'm a college student, and I've been developing this game in my spare time. The game doesn't have any story and isn't actually playable yet.
## Purpose
This is my first C and raylib project, so I'm using it as a playground to learn new techniques and skills. My goal is a very simple RPG gameplay: leveling, inventory, different armor, weapons, skills, classes, and a small open world with one dungeon.
